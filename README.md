# Colour Constancy in Virtual Reality

The two indoor and outdoor setups in the study focus on investigating colour constancy mechanisms in virtual reality environments. 

### Indoor Setup
- **Environment:** A realistic office-like space with objects such as a desk, chair, bookshelf, plants, and decorative elements.
- **Illumination:** Single point light source positioned above the observer’s VR actor in the centre of the room. Five illuminants (neutral, blue, green, yellow, red).


### Outdoor Setup
- **Environment:** A naturalistic forest scene with features like trees, cliffs, a lake, rocks, moss, grass, and flowers.
- **Illumination:** A directional light paired with a skylight to simulate natural conditions, with adjustments based on illuminant colours. Five illuminants (neutral, blue, green, yellow, red).

Both setups utilized VR to maintain experimental control, allowing for precise manipulations of illumination and visual cues while preserving immersive, realistic conditions. The study aimed to understand how mechanisms like local surround, maximum flux, and spatial mean influence colour constancy under different coloured illumination.

### Local Surround mechanism

The local surround mechanism examines the influence of immediate surroundings on colour constancy.

**Purpose:**

To test the impact of silencing the local surround cue on colour constancy performance.

**Implementation:**

The target object (a lizard) was placed in a self-illuminated leaf with a fixed chromaticity regardless of the illuminant colour.

**Objective**
The study investigates colour constancy under conditions with two illuminants, focusing on tasks like selection, asymmetric matching, and achromatic adjustment.

**Methodology**
  1. Selection Task:

      ` Participants identify a "Lonely Kula" object under two neutral illuminants and later in a coloured room using a controller.
      Objects include cubes and spheres.`

  2. Asymmetric Matching:

        ` Adjust the test object’s colour to match a reference object by sliding a controller’s trackpad.`

  3. Achromatic Adjustment:

        `Adjust the test object’s colour to appear achromatic under both neutral and coloured illuminants.
        Two object positions were tested.`

**Quantification**

Colour Constancy Index (CCI): Measures performance by comparing the differences between test and reference matches under neutral and coloured illuminants.

**Preliminary Results**

  1. Selection Task:
      - Achieved the highest CCI scores.
      - Shows preference for cubes over spheres.

  2. Asymmetric Matching:
     - Challenging for participants.
     - Poor CCI due to difficulty and coarse adjustments.
 
  3. Achromatic Adjustment:
     - No significant differences between positions.
     - Moderate CCI performance.
